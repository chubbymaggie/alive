Alive: Automatic LLVM's Instcombine Verifier
============================================

Alive is a tool that can prove the correctness of InstCombine optimizations
specified in a high-level language.

WARNING: This tool is not complete and its results should not be relied upon.


Requirements
------------
Alive requires Python 2.7.x and Z3 4.3.2 (or later), which can be obtained
from http://z3.codeplex.com


Generating Benchmarks
---------------------
Alive will automatically generate benchmarks in SMT-LIB 2 format when the
'bench' directory exists and when python is run in non-optimized mode (the
default).
These benchmarks are over the bit-vector theory and may or may not have
quantifiers.


Regarding Z3's license
----------------------
Z3 is licensed under Microsoft Research License Agreement (MSR-LA), which
forbids commercial usage.
It is, however, our and Microsoft's understanding that using Z3 with Alive for
the development of LLVM does not constitute commercial usage for the following
reasons:

 1. LLVM is not a commercial product of any particular company.
 2. Alive is free.

Questions regarding Z3's license should be directed to Behrooz Chitsaz
(behroozc@microsoft.com), the Director of IP at Microsoft Research, who kindly
offered to answer any question regarding the usage of Z3 within Alive.
